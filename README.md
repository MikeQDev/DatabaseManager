DatabaseManager
===============

Database Management system created during my senior year of highschool.

Coded from scratch in Java and uses MySQL as the database.


IMPORTANT: In order for this program to run you must have MySQL running and access to a valid MySQL account.

I'm aware that this code is extremely messy and has room for improvement, but it is one of the first 'big' projects that I've created.
